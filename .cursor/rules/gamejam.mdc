I'm organizing the

üåü 2025 Vibe Coding Game Jam

Deadline to enter: 25 March 2025, so you have 7 days

- anyone can enter with their game
- at least 80% code has to be written by AI 
- game has to be accessible on web without any login or signup and free-to-play (preferrably its own domain or subdomain)
- game has to be multiplayer by default
- can use any engine but usually ThreeJS is recommended
- NO loading screens and heavy downloads (!!!) has to be almost instantly in the game (except maybe ask username if you want)

The jury: me, and I will ask some real game dev people to jury too

Gold, silver and bronze winners will be tweeted out and if companies want to sponsor prizes that works too

General sponsors welcome to, just DM me!

I hope this will help give the best vibe coded games more distribution!

I'll add a form to enter your game below this tweet

I FORGOT ONE IMPORTANT RULE:
- game HAS to work on mobile WEB like iPhone, I recommend you use NippleJS, not mobile app (!!!), mobile web! Like a website that you can open on iPhone and play like http://fly.pieter.com


- add this code to show you're an entrant:
